## ü§î The Problem

Getting kids to eat their **5 A Day** is challenging. Getting them to eat a **varied selection** of their 5 A Day is even more challenging. But in a healthy nutrition, it's not only the quanitity of plants that matters, the diversity also plays a key role. It's no good just living from bananas every day. But preaching that to a toddler or young child usually falls on deaf ears. We need **smarter tools** to get kids to eat a substanial, varied diet. And as everyone knows, the best tool to get any kid to do anything: **games**. 

## üí° The Solution 

Banana Bingo is a tablet game for children to track daily fruit and veg consumption in a fun and educational way. The catch: You can only with if you eat your 5 A Day. The more varied and numerous your plant consumption, the higher your chances of winning. A integrated dashboard informs parents about the daily and weekly plant consumptio of their kids.
